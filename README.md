##  üçΩÔ∏è Food App Projet

This project utilizes Tailwind CSS to build custom designs without writing traditional CSS. Whether you‚Äôre new to frontend development or looking to streamline your CSS workflow, this project will provide you with essential knowledge to start using Tailwind CSS effectively.

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes to build designs directly in your markup. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that come with pre-designed components, Tailwind focuses on providing small, composable utility classes to help you create your own unique designs. This approach allows for greater flexibility and customization while keeping your HTML clean and semantic.

## üåü Features

- **Utility-First**: Build designs by applying utility classes directly in your HTML.
- **Customizable**: Tailwind CSS allows you to customize your design system by configuring utility classes, colors, spacing, and more.
- **Responsive**: Easily create responsive designs using Tailwind‚Äôs responsive utility classes.
- **Performance**: Tailwind‚Äôs utility classes are purged in production builds, resulting in smaller CSS files.
